Original input text: The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10-20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin.

Original input text: The requirements for the front line of air traffic control are a poor match for AI's capabilities. People expect air traffic to continue to be the safest complex, high-technology system ever.It achieves this standard by adhering to procedures when practical, which is something AI can do, and by adapting and exercising good judgment whenever something unplanned occurs or a new operation is implemented - a notable weakness of today's AI. Indeed, it is when conditions are the worst - when controllers figure out how to handle aircraft with severe problems, airport crises or widespread airspace closures due to security concerns or infrastructure failures - that controllers' contributions to safety are the greatest.
Simpler output text: Air traffic control needs skills that Artificial Intelligence does not have.\nAir traffic systems are difficult technology systems.\nPeople think air traffic systems are very safe systems.\n Air traffic systems can take good decisions in unexpected situations.\nAir traffic systems adapt to changes.\nArtificial Intelligence adapts worse than air traffic systems.\nAir controllers help mantain security and safety specially when there are problems.
